on-time. Our customers are always surprised that our projects are completed in a
pleasant manner with the least interruption to their normal routines. This happens
because we patiently work with our clients to ensure they understand the data ask
the first time and know how to get the information with the least amount of effort.
We also work with each entity to make sure they get the information in the format
they need. We understand Financial Statements are not the only place where
results are reported. Therefore, we start each project asking management how and
where their organization reports their results in order to ensure their unique needs
are met.
Finally, our reports include simple descriptions explaining how results were
calculated with thorough documentation of underlying assumptions and benefits.
We ask ourselves “Would another actuary be able to read the report and reproduce
our results without having to call us once?” Our report goal is readability and
transparency. This demystifies the OPEB calculation and allows the City to be 100%
confident that results accurately reflect incurred benefits and are in accord with
Actuarial standards.
| Technoloay 2 keeping with our focused philosophy, we use precisely the right tool for the right
job without needing to tout expensive, little used or irrelevant software. All
repeatable tasks have been automated with either industry-leading software
solutions or custom-built Jefferson Proprietary Solutions. In whole, each element
integrates together so that we maximize your total value with the most efficient
and comprehensive delivery system.

| Meta-Process Meta-technology: We employ Salesforce as our project CRM software to
manage the entire, well defined, client process from start to finish. It tracks the
current project stage, upcoming tasks, who is assigned, and expected delivery so
that each phase is completed without backlogs or delays. We have configured
Salesforce so that any team member can seamlessly pick up and support any
client at any stage during times of seasonal high-demand and in advance of those
unexpected life-events.

) Actuarial Accuracy Actuarial Software and Integrated Systems: Jefferson Solution uses the
national-standard and industry-leading ProVal® pension and OPEB valuation
software (WinTech/Winklevoss Technologies, LLC) to ensure accurate results
with the latest regulatory updates. However, we differentiate ourselves with our
proprietary Input-Output ProVal® software integration.

a. Input: Our automated data intake step, developed over 17 years, validates the
census for any errors and creates an automated audit trail of corrections.

b. Programming and Coding: While assumptions, benefits, and eligibility are
unique to each client, we developed proprietary nomenclature which
standardizes the coding process, enables efficient programming of any plan
designs, allows any one team member to pick up where another one left off,
and standardizes our review process. This ensures reproduceable, accurate
results. Plan changes and scenario tests are completed with quick updates of
easily located and identified fields.

c. Output: Although ProVal® exports generic CSV files, we built a specially
designed spreadsheet which imports summary and detailed results, performs
any additional calculations, automatically prepares results for transfer into the
final report, and applies another layer of checks and validation. At this stage,
information is automatically assembled and calculated in preparation for the
next automated transfer into the report.

| Reports Reporting: We start with a proprietary, configurable template that facilitates
quick customization to each client-specific narrative while preserving essential
automation. Automated links import and refresh results from our spreadsheet to
the report with one simple key stroke. Values are never manually cut and pasted
thereby avoiding error prone mistakes. At this stage, our process includes yet
another level of automated checks which compare final report values to ProVal®
results ensuring line-of-sight validation from calculation to presentation.
The benefits to the City are a straight-forward process; simple customer experience;
secure information collection and transfer; elimination of potential data,
calculation, and transfer errors; use of areproduceable, auditable process which any
team member can pick up at any stage; quick modifications; on-time delivery;
proactively eliminates delays; automated, multiple validations; and quality
assurance. We maximize efficiency and value by utilizing our expertise exactly at
Stages where and when its needed.
The Jefferson Solution’s team has extensive experience with pension plan and
OPEB actuarial valuation projects. We have performed thousands of GASB-
compliant actuarial valuations for numerous municipalities, government agencies,
and private entities throughout the United States. And when those occasional,
Unique circumstances arise beyond our core business, we tap our extensive
network, built over decades, to supplement our team with experts in those
specialized areas. Our overriding goal is to ensure that your organization’s
expectations and needs are met or exceeded.

While often overlooked, our reports include word-for-word footnotes developed
from Ray's CPA and auditing experience. These greatly simplify office staff tasks by
allowing easy cutting and pasting into the Town Financial Statements
Project Approach:
Jefferson Solutions, Inc. follows a method we call the A.B.C.’s of Pension and OPEB Reporting
which serve as our building blocks for each report.

A. Assumptions: We review assumptions from the prior report and assess their
appropriateness for the current year. Assumptions for the City’s OPEB valuation
should be consistent with those used in any pension valuation. Key assumptions are
the return on investments, medical cost trends, election or participation rates,
terminations, retirements, and mortality. For rate of return on investments, we follow
the GASB standards in conjunction with a review of asset performance. For medical
cost trend, we use recommended short-term rates in conjunction with a model
approved by the Society of Actuaries (like what was previously used by the City). The
remaining assumptions, such as election and participation rates, are developed from
actual experience where appropriate. Before finalizing, we discuss and reach
agreement on all assumptions with the direction of the City.

B. Benefits: Understanding benefits is a critical component to arrive at correct results.
We review prior year reports and confirm any plan design changes. We confirm the
latest Pre/Post-65-Commercial/Medicare claim costs and premiums. We develop
appropriate age/gender adjustments per Actuarial Standard ASOP 6. We confirm
contribution percentages and eligibility, paying particular attention to special cohorts
or grandfathered groups. As necessary, we incorporate all changes into the valuations.
All benefits are completely and carefully described in the report.

C. Census (participant demographic information): We analyze the census and compare
it with the prior year’s census to check for inconsistencies and to ensure that it is
complete. Any anomalies will be discussed with the City for clarification or resolution.
Upon issuing draft reports, we include complete census reconciliations that explains
how each person was valued. Since the results are only as good as the underlying data,
we will work closely with the City to ensure a complete and accurate census.

We say it is the A.B.C. formula in order to keep things simple, however the project usually
flows from the understanding of the benefits, onto the review of the census, and finally with
a discussion to reach agreement on the assumptions with the city. In the end, B.C.A. is how
the project will likely proceed.

Jefferson Solutions, Inc. has a proven 20-year track record for consistently providing high
quality, comprehensive OPEB Actuarial Valuation and Reporting Services on-time and within
budget for clients in Florida and nationwide.
The city requested that we comment on specific knowledge of Florida’s requirements as may
related to the scope of services. Jefferson Solutions, Inc. has carefully reviewed the OPEB
reports prepared by Foster and Foster, one of the industry's best firms. Based on this review
we are not aware of any nuances in the OPEB reporting that are particular to the state of
Florida. In our opinion, this report is a standard GABS 75 report with a variety of benefits
offered based on the employee’s classification, tier, and hire date. Jefferson Solutions, Inc.
can confidently state that this project is well within our capabilities.

Project Approach:
Jefferson Solutions, Inc. follows a method we call the A.B.C.’s of Pension and OPEB Reporting
which serve as our building blocks for each report.

A. Assumptions: We review assumptions from the prior report and assess their
appropriateness for the current year. Assumptions for the City OPEB valuation should
be consistent with those used in any pension valuation. Key assumptions are the return
on investments, medical cost trends, election or participation rates, terminations,
retirements, and mortality. For rate of return on investments, we follow the GASB
standards in conjunction with a review of asset performance. For medical cost trend,
we use recommended short-term rates in conjunction with a model approved by the
Society of Actuaries (like what was previously used by the City). The remaining
assumptions, such as election and participation rates, are developed from actual
experience where appropriate. Before finalizing, we discuss and reach agreement on
all assumptions with the direction of the City.

B. Benefits: Understanding benefits is a critical component to arrive at correct results.
We review prior year reports and confirm any plan design changes. We confirm the
latest Pre/Post-65-Commercial/Medicare claim costs and premiums. We develop
appropriate age/gender adjustments per Actuarial Standard ASOP 6. We confirm
contribution percentages and eligibility, paying particular attention to special cohorts
or grandfathered groups. As necessary, we incorporate all changes into the valuations.
All benefits are completely and carefully described in the report.

C. Census (participant demographic information): We analyze the census and compare
it with the prior year’s census to check for inconsistencies and to ensure that it is
complete. Any anomalies will be discussed with the City for clarification or resolution.
Upon issuing draft reports, we include complete census reconciliations that explains
how each person was valued. Since the results are only as good as the underlying data,
we will work closely with the City to ensure a complete and accurate census.

The city’s RFP indicates that Jefferson Solutions, Inc. should state how it will address

competing timelines, inter-project dependencies, and our assumptions for this project. Our

response is as follows:

- Jefferson Solutions, Inc. will provide the city with a list of items needed for the project with
approximately 30 days to complete and submit. We believe that this is sufficient time for
the city to gather information that it is familiar with. We do not believe that there will be
any competing timelines or inter-dependencies during this time.

- At some point during the project, the auditor will be requesting a copy of the GASB 75
report. We intend to deliver a signed final report by October 15*°. We do not believe that
this will cause any delays to the audit.

- Assumptions:

- We are assuming that the city is familiar with the nature of the requested items needed
for the project and that the information will be provided by the requested date.

- Weare assuming that the census data provided by the city will be complete and accurate.
We will evaluate this census and notify the city immediately if we cannot proceed with
the data.

- Desired Outcome: A final report delivered to the city by October 15".

The reports prepared by Jefferson Solutions, Inc. will contain information on the following:

Actuarial Opinion: The firm’s opinion on the actuarial results presented. All reports are

certified by an actuary that has the highest credentials (EA, FSA, MAAA).

Executive Summary: A brief summary and presentation of key results.

Summary of Plan Provisions: Written descriptions of the retirement benefits provided.

Principal Results: Presentation of Total OPEB liability and OPEB expense. The OPEB liability

is presented for actives and retirees separately. This section also includes the detail of items

included in OPEB Expense.

Actuarially Determined Contribution: Jefferson Solutions, Inc.'s report includes a

presentation of the actuarially determined contribution for each year presented.

Projected Benefit Payments: The report shows the projected OPEB payments on a pay-as-

you-go basis for a minimum of ten years.

Deferred Charges: Deferred charges are summarized in the body of the report and in the

suggested footnotes. The actuarial report includes an analysis of deferred charges from prior

periods with the addition of current year gains / losses. These combined deferred charges are
presented in a consolidated format showing the current year amortization to be included in
the annual OPEB expense.

Schedule
Project Plan
The project plan outlined below has been used by Jefferson Solutions, Inc. for almost two
decades. This approach has proven successful, produces accurate results, and completes on-
time with minimal impact to entities’ staff. Only one item in this plan is on the critical path.
Our steps for a successful valuation include:
Review Prior Year Reports: The Jefferson Solutions team (JEFSI) will review prior year reports
to refine the methodology for the engagement and determine the exact census data that will
be required from the City.
Planning Call and Administration: Jefferson Solutions, Inc. will schedule a planning to
introduce the firm's project team and plan the engagement, review project steps and timeline,
discuss draft reports, and answer any questions. We will also present and explain the
templates to be used for data collection. Jefferson Solutions, Inc. will present the formal
results when final reports are issued. Meeting frequency and timing can be arranged at the
convenience of each member entity.
Review of Census: JEFSI will review the census data (provided by the City) and ensure that it
is suited for use in the actuarial study. Any data discrepancies identified will be communicated
to the City for correction (if any). Please note that we do not audit any data provided by City.
Critical Path comment: Accuracy of this data impacts the timing of this project.
Develop Actuarial Models: JEFSI will work with the City to develop actuarial models used in
the calculation of the GASB 74/75 report. This helps to ensure that we fully understand the
benefits and that the City agrees with the approach to our calculations. JEFSI will use these
models to generate preliminary valuation results for the OPEB plan.
Draft Report: Preliminary reports and census reconciliation are sent to the City for review and
comment.
Report Finalization: Modifications (as needed) will be made to preliminary reports and
finalized.
Final Report: Jefferson Solutions will deliver the final actuarial valuation report to the City by
a date no later than October 15" for each contracted reporting year.
Meet with City: Ona date TBD, Jefferson Solutions, Inc. will meet with City to review the final
OPEB report and to answer any questions.

2028. All services will be performed in accordance with the Actuarial Standards of Practice,

the Actuarial Code of Professional Conduct, and the Governmental Accounting Standards

Board Statement No. 75 (or other standard as applicable as of the reporting dates).

The city has requested that Jefferson Solutions, Inc. address the following items for the OPEB

report:

- Actuarial cost methodology: This has been established by the GASB 75 standard. The
actuarial cost method to be used is entry-age normal as a percentage of salary. Unlike
GASB 45 which allowed one of six methods to be employed, GASB 75 has made this
determination to allow for comparability between various government financial
statements.

- Amortization method: There are two different amortizations to be considered.

- The first type of amortization relates to the amortization of the Total OPEB Liability
for purposed of developing the Actuarially Determined Contribution (sometimes
referred to as the ADC). The GASB 75 standard has provided suggested guidelines for
selecting an amortization period. For the city, Jefferson Solutions, Inc. would suggest
reducing the prior period by one year.

- The second item that requires amortization are the deferred charges. Jefferson
Solutions, Inc. will use the amortization bases developed in prior years to amortize any
carry forward balances. For current gains or losses, the amortization period will be
based on the GASB 75 requirements that indicate that such charges "be recognized
using a systematic and rational method over a closed period equal to the average of the
expected remaining service lives of all employees that are provided with benefits through
the plan (active employees and inactive employees), determined at the beginning of the
measurement period.” Please note that this period can vary from year to year based on
the census composition.

- Key valuation assumptions: The most significant assumptions used in a GABS 75 valuation
are the discount rate, trend rate, decrement rates, marital rates, mortality, and
participation rates. Jefferson Solutions, Inc. approach to these assumptions is as follows:
- Discount Rate: GASB 75 has provided guidance on the establishment of the discount

rate. The city’s September 30, 2023 report is based the S&P 20-year municipal bond
rate resulting in a discount rate of 4.77%. This discount rate falls within the guidelines
of the standard. Jefferson Solutions, Inc. will use a consistent approach in preparing
the September 30, 2024 report for the city.

- Trend Rates: Trends are used to project the future cost of the underlying benefits.
Jefferson Solutions, Inc. will use the actual rates of increase when known, and the
Getzen Model from the Society of Actuaries for periods subsequent to the
measurement date.

- Decrement Rates: These rates are for the rate of withdrawal, disability, or retirement.
Based on the relatively small size of the city, we recommend using rates for the state-
wide retirement plan unless other information or trends are evident. Experience for
each of these items is evaluated in each reporting cycle to determine if adjustments
are needed for the city’s unique circumstances.

- Mortality: Jefferson Solutions, Inc. will continue to use the PUB 2010 tables to address
mortality with separate rates being applied to active and retirees based on the
employee / retiree’s employment classification.

- Marital and Participation Rates: These rates will be developed after a careful review of
the census to determine the behavior patterns of emerging retirees.

Jefferson Solutions, Inc. will review the census data (provided by the City) and ensure that it is
suited for use in the actuarial study. Any data discrepancies identified will be communicated
to the City for correction (if any). In addition, Jefferson Solutions, Inc. will provide the city with
a detailed census reconciliation showing the treatment for each record. Any record that is not
included in the final report will have a detailed reason for the exclusion. Auditors have
commented that Jefferson Solutions, Inc. is unique in providing this reconciliation, noting that
this reduces audit time on the OPEB portion of the engagement.
Other Assumptions for Consideration: In consultation with the City, Jefferson Solutions, Inc.
will assist in determining the proper key assumptions appropriate for the actuarial valuation.
The following assumptions would be considered:
e Amortization and Timeframe e Mortality
e Disability Retirement Age e Projected Salary increase.
e Healthcare Cost Trend Data for the e Turnover

geographic region of the City e Retirement Age
e Inflation Rate e Post-retirement Benefit Increase
Jefferson Solutions, Inc. will meet with the City’s designated staff to answer questions
regarding matters of actuarial science, financial analysis, legislative changes, and effected or
proposed changes in actuarial assumptions (including interest rates) as related to GASB 75.

6.39 FRONT LOADING PRICING PROHIBITED
Prices offered for performance and/or acquisition activities, which occur early in the Project Schedule,
such as mobilization; clearing and grubbing; or maintenance of traffic; that are substantially higher than
pricing of competitive proposals within the same portion of the Project Schedule, will be presumed to be
front-loaded. Front loaded bids/proposals could reasonably appear to be an attempt to obtain
unjustified early payments creating a risk of insufficient incentive for the Proposer to complete the Work
or otherwise creating an appearance of an undercapitalized Bidder or Proposer.
In the event the City determines that a proposal is presumed to be front loaded, it will request the
opportunity to, and reserves the right to, review all source quotes, bids, price lists, letters of intent, and
other documents which the Proposer obtained and upon which the Proposer relied upon to develop the
pricing or acquisition timing for the proposed items. The City reserves the right to reject as
nonresponsive any presumptive front-loaded bids or proposals where the proposer is unable to
demonstrate the validity and/or necessity of the front-loaded costs.

6.40 PUBLIC EMERGENCIES

hurricane, tornado, flood, or other acts of God, the City of Casselberry shall require a “First Priority” for

Casselberry are protected from any emergency situation that threatens public health and safety as
determined by the City. The Proposer agrees to rent/sell/lease all goods and services to the City or
governmental entities on a “first priority” basis. The City expects to pay contractual prices for all
products and/or services under the awarded agreement in the event of a disaster, emergency,
hurricane, tornado, flood, or other acts of God. Should the Proposer provide the City with products
and/or services not under the awarded agreement, the City expects to pay a fair and reasonable price
for all products and/or services rendered or contracted in the event of a disaster, emergency, hurricane,
tornado, flood, or other acts of God.

6.41 SCRUTINIZED COMPANIES
Pursuant to Section 287.135, Florida Statutes (2017), a company is ineligible to, and may not, bid on,
submit a proposal for, or enter into or renew a contract with the City for goods or services of one million
dollars or more if at the time of bidding or submitting a proposal for a new contract or renewal of an

of goods or services with any scrutinized company referred to above. The Contractor must submit the

If the patient is oriented to Person only, meaning they know who they are but may not be aware of where they are, the current time, or why they are in their current situation, then respond "A&Ox1".  This level of orientation might be seen in patients with significant cognitive impairment or certain neurological conditions.  If the patient is oriented to Place and Person, then respond "A&Ox2".

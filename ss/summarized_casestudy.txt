The patient is a [U-AGE]-year-old male with a psychiatric history of bipolar disorder, PTSD, and polysubstance abuse who has been admitted due to suicidal ideation with a plan to overdose on prescription medication. His mental state has declined since the passing of his fiancé, with increasing feelings of depression, hopelessness, and trauma. He has taken a mix of pills, cocaine and alcohol in an attempt to end his life, and reveals that he copes with his feelings by using $80-100 worth of heroin daily. He is currently on quetiapine and suboxone medication. His risk for harm to himself is significantly high, as evidenced by his inability to provide self-care, active suicide thoughts and intentions, a concrete plan for suicide, and inability to promise safety. He requires immediate hospitalization for safety and stabilization. His risk for harm to others is low as he denies any thoughts or plans to harm others. His C-SSRS score at intake is 18, indicating a high suicide risk. Despite his challenging circumstances, he denies any history of assaultive thoughts or behaviors.

The medical report is from a psychiatric evaluation of a patient demonstrating dangerous behaviors towards self, particularly suicidal intent with a plan to overdose on prescribed medication. The overall assessment of judgement and insight abilities is poor, indicating the patient's difficulty to understand the nature of their illness, need for medication, and treatment.

The patient's intellectual functioning appears to be intact, with satisfactory results in attention span, recent memory, remote memory, and abstract reasoning tests. However, their understanding of medical-related information is poor, suggesting a need for further testing.

Regarding their treatment plan, inpatient hospitalization was suggested due to the severity of the patient's symptoms and their failure to respond to outpatient treatments, ultimately causing a deterioration in their condition. The plan includes individual therapy, group therapy, and expressive therapy. 

There is a high risk related to the patient due to their suicidal intent and inability to maintain the safety of themselves or others. The report suggests a marked regression in their symptoms and evidence of severe impairment in daily life tasks.

Regarding a Dementia and Alertness and Orientation assessment, what is the patient's level of alertness and orientation?  The question may refer to Dementia, Alertness, and Orientation, or it may only refer to one or two of these terms (i.e. mention only Alertness of Orientation). If the patient is oriented to Person only, meaning they know who they are but may not be aware of where they are, the current time, or why they are in their current situation, then respond "A&Ox1".  This level of orientation might be seen in patients with significant cognitive impairment or certain neurological conditions.  If the patient is oriented to Place and Person, then respond "A&Ox2".  This could be seen in patients with moderate cognitive impairment. They know who they are and where they are, but they might not know the current time or understand their situation.  Alternatively, if the patient is oriented to Place, Person, and Time, then respond "A&Ox3." This is often considered a baseline level of orientation for many patients.  They are aware of their identity, location, and the current time or date, but they may not fully understand why they are in a medical or mental helath care facility.  Finally, if the patient is oriented to all four levels (Place, Person, Time, and Situation), then respond "A&Ox4".  Sometimes this is described as Place, Person, and Situation because Time is implied in awareness of Situation.  This is the expected orientation level for a healthy individual. They are aware of their identity, their location, the time, and understand the reason for their current situation, such as being hospitalized due to a specific health or mental issue. If possible, include the original page number(s) indicating the source of the response.  If there is no indication or mention of an Alertness and/or Orientation assessment, then respond "A&OxNA".  Omit any summary statements before or after the response.

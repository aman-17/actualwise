The medical report discusses the testing of cranial nerves. The patient appears to be in normal health, as all tested cranial nerves (CN I, II, III, IV, VI, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII) were within normal limits (WNL). These tests included "Sniff and Identify," the Confrontation Test, Finger Tracking, Light touch on the forehead, Eyebrow raise, Finger rub near the ear, Palate elevation, and Shoulder shrug. The Plan of Care is not specified in the available text. The Medical History and Physical examination (H&P) also showed normal observations.

------------------------------
The psychiatric assessment report shares information about a patient who has a history of non-success with less intensive outpatient settings. They have a medical history which includes blood clot disorders, hip replacement, back surgery, seizures from withdrawal, sciatica, and bipolar disorder. Surgically, they've had a lumbar fusion, back surgery, and a total left hip arthroplasty. However, none of these medical or surgical histories contribute to their current psychiatric presentation. The patient's allergies and home medication details were also reviewed.
